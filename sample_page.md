## Jim Comey, Senate Intelligence Committee, June 2017: A test site for NLP techniques
*What can Jim Comey's testimony tell us about using natural language processing techniques to analyze court proceedings?*

**Project description:** Contextualization is more difficult for machines than humans. As current ML techniques stand, this is especially true in tasks related to understanding natural language - language as it is freely spoken or written by individuals, rather than one that has been designed, like a computer language. Full of idioms and turns of phrase, individual eccentricities, and complicated tones, it can prove difficult for any of us, machine or human, to understand what others are saying.  
    The halls of Congress, for example, are often home to proceedings that flummox both human and machine interpreters. While humans are able to easily understand what the members of the house or senate committees and the respondents are saying, it can be difficult to assess what they *mean*. Computers, with a perhaps more rudimentary grasp of tone and expression (if at all), face an even greater challenge. Throw in the soup of motivations of all parties that lies bubbling in the background of these questionings and the tightrope that respondents must walk, and it seems truly impossible that, on the surface, natural language processing techniques can tell us anything about these proceedings that the hundreds of politicos, journalists, and talking heads across the country who are paid to perform the very task of interpreting the testimony cannot. And yet, applying these techniques in this context is extremely tempting.
  - First, **most congressional testimonies are important**. If there is any marginal improvement to be had in the information to be gained from analyzing these proceedings, it should be made. 
- Transcripts are legally required to be made and released to the public after an open testimony, providing a **clean, high-quality, and easily processed** dataset that is almost unparalleled in its ease of access.
- Focusing on only text as data, rather than visual cues, might allow for analysts to understand testimonies in a way that is **free of visual bias** stemming from one’s appearance and inferred demographics, whether related to age, race, gender, or any other visual presentation.
- NLP techniques allow for the simultaneous **processing of large volumes of testimonies at once**, allowing analysis of a corpus of data whose size would be prohibitive for qualitative research.
- NLP techniques also present a **unified framework** that can be applied across different testimonies. These frameworks could be used to compare performances by senators or representatives or testifiers across hearings, or compare how hearings on the same subject are distinctive depending on who the senators or representatives are.

To me, it seems like applying NLP techniques to transcripts of court proceedings could open up a whole new realm of analytical possibility. And yet, it is clear that they might have to be applied awkwardly, and that there may be some trial-and-error surrounding the questions these techniques can and cannot be used to answer.

Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transcripts of congressional testimonies allows for a whole new realm of analytical possibility. 
  In order to explore some of the potential uses and pitfalls of applying NLP techniques to congressional testimonies, I used former FBI Chief James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8th, 2017. The purpose of the Congressional hearing was to determine whether James Comey had been fired from his role as FBI Chief due to shortcomings in the role, or due to political motivations of the president, who may have been dissatisfied by Comey’s refusal to shut down the investigation of the FBI into accusations of obstruction of justice by Michael Flynn, a former aide of the president. 
  This testimony in particular provides a particularly rich corpus on which to test NLP techniques, because James Comey's political position in June 2017 was fascinatingly complicated. Contextualization

  Republicans may treat Comey more favorably, as he has asserted that the president is not under investigation and has served under other Republican presidents as attorney general, making him a sympathetic figure to the party. Democrats may be more willing to take a more aggressive tack toward his questioning, due to the possibility that it was Comey’s announcement of the re-opening of an investigation against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, that led to the party’s loss in the 2016 election. 
  The possibility that there is a distinction in the topic and tone of questioning between senators of different parties also introduces the opportunity to do a supervised learning exercise in order to identify the party of the questioner. If a well-tuned interpretable machine learning model can predict the party of a questioner above the level of chance, it could reveal distinctions between parties and senators that are not apparent from qualitative analysis.
