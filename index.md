[Jim Comey, June 2017: A natural language processing story, volume I](/comey_page)

On June 8, 2017, former FBI Chief James Comey testified before the Select Senate Intelligence committee about his understanding of the President's interests regarding the investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. This is part I of a dive into his testimony using natural language processing techniques, in order to answer the larger question of how (and perhaps whether!) NLP techniques can be useful in analyzing court proceedings.

[Ambassadors and democracies](/ambassadors)

The United States is nearly alone among advanced democracies in offering nearly one-third of its ambassadorships on average to individuals who are not career diplomats, but well-funded supporters of presidential campaigns. Does the share of ambassadors who are political appointees vary depending on the regime type of the host country?

### Publications and contributions

- [Realism about Reskilling](https://www.brookings.edu/research/realism-about-reskilling/) *(Contributor)*  
Realism about Reskilling is a report released by The Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education on industrial and occupational shifts in domestic metropolitan economies, and the role of reskilling initiatives in helping low-wage workers navigate those changes.
- [Opportunity Industries](https://www.brookings.edu/research/opportunity-industries/) *(Co-author)*  
Opportunity Industries is an examination of occupational transitions in U.S. metropolitan areas from 2007 to 2017. In a first-of-its-kind analysis, it identifies jobs that have a promising future for workers without a bachelor's degree based on historical transitions. This is a series of three reports for three geographies: [the 100 largest U.S. metro areas](https://www.brookings.edu/research/opportunity-industries/), [Central Indiana](https://www.brookings.edu/research/advancing-opportunity-in-central-indiana/), and [Riverside-San Bernardino, California](https://www.brookings.edu/research/advancing-opportunity-in-californias-inland-empire/).
- [The Metro Monitor](https://www.brookings.edu/research/metro-monitor-2019-inclusion-remains-elusive-amid-widespread-metro-growth-and-rising-prosperity/) *(Co-author)*  
The Metro Monitor is a dashboard with meaning and heart. Carefully curated by the extremely conscientious and locally-engaged thinkers at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, it contains indicators of the economic growth, prosperity, and inclusion of each of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. I crunched the numbers and wrote snippets of this report, then stood back and admired Alec Friedhoff's visualization genius from afar.
