### Publications and contributions

- [Realism about Reskilling](https://www.brookings.edu/research/realism-about-reskilling/) *(Contributor)*  
Realism about Reskilling is a report released by The Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education on industrial and occupational shifts in domestic metropolitan economies, and the role of reskilling initiatives in helping low-wage workers navigate those changes.
- [Opportunity Industries](https://www.brookings.edu/research/opportunity-industries/) *(Co-author)*  
Opportunity Industries is an examination of occupational transitions in U.S. metropolitan areas from 2007 to 2017. In a first-of-its-kind analysis, it identifies jobs that have a promising future for workers without a bachelor's degree based on historical transitions. This is a series of three reports for three geographies: [the 100 largest U.S. metro areas](https://www.brookings.edu/research/opportunity-industries/), [Central Indiana](https://www.brookings.edu/research/advancing-opportunity-in-central-indiana/), and [Riverside-San Bernardino, California](https://www.brookings.edu/research/advancing-opportunity-in-californias-inland-empire/).
- [The Metro Monitor](https://www.brookings.edu/research/metro-monitor-2019-inclusion-remains-elusive-amid-widespread-metro-growth-and-rising-prosperity/) *(Co-author)*  
The Metro Monitor is a dashboard with meaning and heart. Carefully curated by the extremely conscientious and locally-engaged thinkers at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, it contains indicators of the economic growth, prosperity, and inclusion of each of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas. I crunched the numbers and wrote snippets of this report, then stood back and admired Alec Friedhoff's visualization genius from afar.
